 <!----structure of code from line 9 - 16, depicts how to implement "React" using HTML.
 here, in above scenerio, 2 external libraries are used for React , bc React can be used in different places as 
per its "working or operating convenience or usecase",i.e, React is used in both websites and mobile apps, so it is 
necessary to provide 2 external libraries for its implementation,i.e,
1) line 10 -> "React" =  provides shared features, which means, by enforcing external library on line 10, we can imply our React
operations on both websites and mobile apps, so, writing of line 10 is necessary while React implementation.
2) line 11 -> "ReactDOM" = provides features specific to websites, for carrying out implementaion of React on websites.

Thus,  1) to create websites using React -> we load "React" and "ReactDOM".
       2) to create mobile apps using React -> we load "React" and "ReactNative".

-> in above scenerio, line 10 and line 11 loads the external libraries to be used in React.

in line 12, we load the external library related to "babel", where,:-
**) Babel -> is a javaScript compiler, used to translate other languages into javaScript.

so basically, while using React, we don't use normal JS,i.e, we use an enhanced version of JS -> that is -> 'JSX("javaScript XML")'.

so basically, JSX(javaScript XML) is mostly same as javaScript, but we can write HTML directly in our JS code, in case of "JSX".

-> so, initially, our web browser can't understand JSX, therefore, we need to translate JSX into JS, and this is  done by the external
library, we used above, that is -> "babel"(i.e, babel translates JSX into JS).

here, in above case, the code on line 13 forces "babel" to convert the type of text from "JSX" to "JS", so that, web browser
can understand "JSX" via "JS"(as in this case, it will actually read "JS" and it will simply go through "JS").
