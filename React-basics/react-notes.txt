React is an external library,i.e,:-
-> it is a bunch of code that is outside our computer.
-> we can load this code on our website, and use it.

so basically, React --> is an external library, that helps us create website easier.

(*) ReactDOM.createRoot() --> it is used to set up React.

(*)render --> feature of React, which is used to display something.
syntax of using render with React :-  ReactDOM.createRoot(<html element>).render("/statement to be displayed");

so, React "helps us create website easier" by promising following things,:-

(1) Creating a website wiht React "feels natural"
(2) it is easier to recognize errors, if we are creating and manipulating HTML elements with the help of "React".
(3) we can insert values inside "JSX" elements without using the concept of "string interpolation" by using "babel" external
library of React.

--> in JSX, nearly every HTML element needs opening as well as closing tags.
--> JSX is more strict than normal HTML.

(*) Components in React 
--> Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
--> They are basically a piece of the website.
--> We can create our own HTML elements using Components
--> Basically, we use two types of Components, i.e, Class components and Function components.
**--> components makes a particular section of code reusable, by providing it with a standard function component name, i.e, the 
piece (or component) can be used for several no. of times by just calling the self-closing component of the functional component.

(*) Usecase of Components :- Basically, while building a website, it is easier to implement the functioning of the website
and to improve the flexibility of the website by splitting the website into smaller pieces(Components), i.e, by splitting
the website into smaller pieces(or components), we can work on a small piece of the website at a time.

--> So, basically, the pieces or parts in which the website has been splitted into, are referred to as --> "components".

(*) Self-closing element
--> In React, self-closing elements are tags that do not require a separate closing tag and are written with a forward slash before the closing angle bracket, such as "<img />" or "<input />".

(*) Fragments in React
--> Fragments actually allow us to group elements together, without creating any extra "<div></div>"(which ultimately kind 
 of increases the visibility complexity in the UI of the structure of the HTML in the console section).
--> This makes it  ideal for returning multiple elements from a component's render method without introducing unnecessary 
  wrapper elements like <div>. 
--> It is represented as --> "<></>

(*) Props in React
--> generally, Props or Properties is a functionality of React, which allow us to access the component's attributes, as it is used
in a functional component to access its defined attributes.
--> Props make components(that are used in React) reusable, which ultimately increases the flexibility factor in creating websites.
--> Props are generally of --> "object type"(i.e, datatype of Props--> obejcts).

(*) Destructuring in React
--> in React, we can also extract the properties out of the objects(Props), while using them in Functional components to make the 
code more readable, i.e, Destructuring the object(Props) by extracting the properties out of it, this process is referred to as 
Destructuring.
--> so basically, Destructuring in React is a JavaScript feature introduced in ES6 that allows developers to extract specific values from objects or arrays and assign them to new variables, making code more concise and readable.

(*)Guard operator("&&")
--> for ex:-
const result = val1 && val2;
here, Guard operator(&&) works in a way, i.e,--> if val1 is True, then the result will automatically be val2.
so, basically Guard operator works like an if statement.
--> working of Guard operator is more proficient in JSX(Java script with XML).

-->So basically, in React, we can save a data or information using arrays and objects.

-->In React, any HTML can be generated using ".map()" and key properties, where ".map()" creates a mapping of a certain set of
values into the new values having a unique "Key".

-->any random unique key or id can be generated using --> "crypto.RandomUUID()" in built function of JS.

--> "onClick" and "onChange" are prominent and essential event handlers.

(*)State
--> React components has a built-in state object, which is the Component's own data that can change and cause the UI to re-render.
--> When a state changes, React re-renders the component automatically.
--> Each component can mainatins its own state.
--> State is used for intertactive or dynamic content.
--> It is basically a data that changes over time, and which is connected to the HTML.

--> An array which declares a state in React has :-  (1) arr[0](first element)--> representing the current value present during
rendering of the UI and (2) arr[1](second element)--> representing the updater function(which is responsible for the updates to
the current value of state).

(*)Updater function
--> It is a function which updates the state and eventually updates the HTML as well(as it uses "state" which connects it to the 
HTML).

(*) Lifting the state up --> it means to share the state between the components of a HTML(webpage), by interaction procedure via
the parent(root) HTML element.

(*) Array Destructuring
--> It is simply a JS feature used to extract values from arrays into separate variables.
--> React commonly uses array Destructuring with hooks like useState().

--> Array Destructuring allows you to pull out elements from an array and store them in distinct variables using a clean and 
readable syntax.

(*) "map()" function in JS
---> It is a very useful function in JS, which allows to run a function on each item in the array, returning a new array as the result.
--> in React, "map()" is generally used to generate lists.
---> it is a method which basically iterates over each element of an array, applies a function to it, and returns a new array, 
    commonly used in React to render lists of components without modifying the original array.

(*) Spread operator("...")
--> The JS spread operator allows to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object
--> The spread operator is often used in combination with destructuring, as well as with objects too.
--> In React, it is basically used to expand elements of an array, object, or iterable into individual elements, commonly used to
    copy, merge, or updat state immutably without modifying the original data.

(*) More on the concept of Lifting the State up
--> Basically, Lifting state up is a React concept where state is moved from a child component to their nearest common parent,
so that multiple child components can share and synchronize the same data through props.

(*) onChange event handler
--> React onChange is an event handler that triggers when there is any change in the input field.
--> This event captures the changes in an input field and executes the handler function. It is fired when the input field is modified
    and loses focus.
--> it is one of the "form events" that updates when the input field is modified.
*********---------***************
**Note
--> Generally, event handlers in React uses --> "Camel case convention" generally(for ex. --> onChange,onClick,etc).
**********---------***************

(*)flex-direction(a CSS prop) defaultly aligns the contents inside a flexbox in a horizontal or row manner, so if, we want to 
align the contnets of the flexbox in a vertical or column manner, then we have to assign, :

--> flex-direction : column(in CSS, after display has already been set or assinged to --> flex,i.e, display : flex).

(*)Hooks
--> These are the special functions that let us use or insert React features(state,lifecycle,etc.) in functional components.
---> Common Hooks :
(1) useState
(2) useEffect
(3) useContext
(4) useRef

(*)useEffect hook
--> it runs some code(defined or written inside it) after a particular component is created or updated.
--> it is a React hook used to perform side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM updates in functional components.
--> it runs after the components renders(i.e, created or updated), ensuring the UI is updated before the effect executes.
--> it consists of a dependency array, which controls when the effect runs(on every render, once, or when specific values change).
--> it can return a cleanup function to remove side effects like event listeners or timers when the component unmounts or updates.

--> providing '[]' as dependency array tells implies  useEffect to only run once.

(*)useRef hook
---> it basically saves an HTML element from the particular component. 
---> it is a React hook used to create a mutable reference that persists across component re-renders.
---> it is commonly used to directly access and manipulate DOM elements without causing re-rendering.
---> Updating a "useRef" value does not trigger a re-render, unlike state updates.
---> it is also used to store values(like timers or previous state) that need to persist between renders. 

*********************Terminal commands overview********************************
--> Some of the important terminal commands :
(1) mkdir <directory or folder name to be written here> --> used to create new directory or folder

(2) pwd ---> Used to print the working or current directory or folder

(3) ls ----> It lists everything present inside the working directory or folder.

(4) cd <directory or folder name to be written here> --> this command is used to change the working or current directory to
the directory which is specified alongside "cd"(i.e, abbreviation of cd --> current directory).

(5) .. => This represents outer folder, i.e, if we have entered an inner folder or a subset folder of outer or superset folder,
and we have to exit form the inner folder all the way to the outer folder, then we can simply use the command, :-

"cd .." --> This command lets us exit an inner folder, all the way to a outer folder.

****************************************Note***************************************************
--> all the above commands are implemented using the terminal of VS code.

************************************************************************************************

(*)Node js overview
--> "node" command in vs code terminal lets us run JavaScript code outside of a browser.

for ex, if we have to run any "JS" file inside terminal only, then we can use 'node' as follows:-

--> node <JS file name>.js   (here, ".js" is implied because, a particular JS file will have '.js' as its extension only), thus,
here "node" helped us run the code outside of the browser, i.e, in the terminal itself.

(*)Package
--> A package is a reusable piece of code(library or tool) published to npm that can be installed and used in a JS or React project
to add specific functionality without writing everything from scratch.
--> It is a type of external library.
--> It is simply a collection of reusable JS code that can be installed and used in a project using npm.
**************************************************************************************

--> "npm" is node package manager which lets us install external libraries(or packages) into our project.

(*) To install a particular package(or external library) using npm, we proceed as follows :-

--> npm install <package name> (This command executes in VS code terminal).

--> "NPM"(webserver) contains millions of packages that we can download and use as per our use cases.

*********Note****************************************************
---> Some packages also adds a command to our command line,i.e,:-

--> The package "create-vite" also adds a command --> "create-vite" to our command line.
--> This "create-vite" command which has been added to our command line, helps us set up a new React project.

--> To use the "create-vite" command, we have to follow several steps,i.e,:-

(1) firstly, we have to install the "create-vite" package using --> npm install create-vite command in the terminal.
(2) then, we have to run "create-vite" command in the command line.

--> We also have a shortcut, to cut down this two way process as follows,:-

-> we can use "npx" to execute the above two steps, required to install "create-vite" package(external library), in a single step,
at once as follows,:- 

---> "npx create-vite@<version of vite to be installed>", (here, 'x' stands for execute, which implies to execute both the installing
and running steps at once).

(*)Various components of React :-

(*)node_modules
--> node_modules is a folder that stores all the npm packages(dependencies) installed for a project, which are required for the
application to run.
--> It is a directory that contains all installed npm packages used by a project.
--> This folder is auto-generated, can be very large, and is usually not shared or uploaded.

************Note****************************
--> "npm run dev" command lets us run our website(i.e, vite server).
********************************************
(*)Public folder
--> it contains files that should be available to the public.
--> we can access these using a URL.

(*)src(Source folder)
--> It is the folder that conatins the main source code of the React application, including components, JS files, styles, and logic
of the app.
--> It is simply a directory, where the main React application code is written and maintained.
--> it is the folder which consist of major work content and consumes most of the working time while building a React app or site.

(*)ESLint tool in JS
--> It is a tool that analyzes JS and React code to find and repot errors, bugs, and code style issues, helping developers write
clean and consistent code.
--> It is simply a tool to identify and fix problems in JS and React code.
--> It improves code quality by investigating and fixing errors in code.

(**)Overview of Vite
--> It is a tool that we use to set up our React project.
--> It also helps us "build" the website.
--> It also helps us creates a server.(i.e, a server puts our website at a URL).
--> (**)Vite lets us import any type of file(**).

(*)package.json
--> It is a configuration file that stores important information about a project, such as project details, scripts, and the list of
required npm packages(dependencies).
--> It kind of tells npm, what the project needs and how it should run.

(*)package-lock.json
--> It is an automatically generated file that records the exact versions of installed npm packages to ensure the project runs
the same way on every system.
--> It kind of locks the exact dependency versions for consistency.


(*)So basically, package.json defines what dependencies are needed, while package-lock.json locks exact versions of those
dependencies.

(*)vite.config.js
--> It is a configuration file used by Vite to define project settings such as plugins, server options, build configurations,
and path aliases.
--> It is a file used to customize and control how a Vite project is built and run.

(*)<StrictMode></StrictMode>
--> It is a  HTML tag in React, which gives us some additional checks and warnings when developing our app.
--> It is a vital component, that is required during building of website using React. 

(*)JavaScript Modules 
-->Js modules are reusable files of code that allow functionality to be divided into separate parts and shared between 
files using "import" and "export" keywords.
-->They are simply a way to organize JS code into reusable files using "import" and "export".
-->They help keep the code organized, maintainable, and easy to reuse.

(*)Named export
-->A named export allows a file to export multiple values by name, and they must be imported using the same names inside curly 
braces.
-->So basically, it is used to export multiple values using their specific names.
--> it uses "curly braces" to enclose names, in order to export them.

(*)Default export
-->A default export allows a file to export a single main value,and it can be imported "using any name".
--> It "Exports one main value" from a file.


(**)So basically, "Named export" requires exact names and "{}"(curly braces), while "default export" allows any import name and 
exports only one value.

(**)Routing in React
--> Routing in react lets us create multiple pages uisng 1 HTML file, which helps us reuse our HTML code.
--> The process of navigating between different components based on the URL without reloading the page.
--> Routing in React is used to navigate between different pages or views in a single-page application (SPA).
--> React uses client-side routing, meaning the page does not reload when navigating.
--> Routing is commonly implemented using React Router.
--> Routes are defined using the <Route> component.
--> The <BrowserRouter> component wraps the application to enable routing.
--> Each route maps a URL path to a specific component.
--> The <Link> component is used for navigation instead of <a> tags.

(*)<Route> component in React
--> The <Route> component is used to define a mapping between a URL path and the React component that should be rendered when that  path is visited.
--> It is used inside "<Routes>" component to handle the navigation between various web pages.

(*)<Routes> component
--> The "<Routes>" component is used to group multiple <Route> components and ensures that only the matching route is rendered.
--> It is a kind of container for all "Route" definitions.

(*)<BrowserRouter> component
--> The <BrowserRouter> component wraps the entire React application and enables routing using the browser’s URL and history API.
--> It basically provides Routing capability to the React app.

(*)<Link> component
--> The <Link> component is used to navigate between routes without reloading the page.
--> They are basically placed, in place of "<a>" tag  to provide smooth and flexible navigation, without reloading the page,
    using JS to do so.
--> Generally, "<Link>" uses an attribute "to" in place of "href" to carry its workflow properly.
